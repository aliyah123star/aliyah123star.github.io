	  			<h1> Crime Statistics in Jamaica</h1>
	  			<p> Crime is now the main public safety issue for Jamaicans and significant threat to the country's human and economic development. Data from the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF), public health data and survey information show high levels of criminality and corruption on the island. Jamaica has homicide rates that are notably higher than both regional and global averages, although since 2017 there has been a significant decline in voilent crimes and indeed serious crimes in general. </p>

	  			<p> In 2017 there was a 7.5% decline in major crime over 2016 (from 437 to 409 per 100,000 inhabitants) and a 15% decline in muder (from 62 to 53 per 100,000 inhabitants.) The trend evident in JCF statistics is also reflected in survery results showing that while crime is considered the most important problem among citizens, reported crime and perception of crime are decreasing across time. </p>

	  			<p> The declined but still very high rate of violent crime is now fuelled by organized crime, gang activities and access to guns among other factors. JCF data shows that in 2018, 79% of homicides were motivated my gang activities. </p>

	  			<p> Administrative data shows that the main victims and prepetrators of voilent crimes are young males between the ages of 16 to 25. Women and girls are the main victims of sexual crimes. Data from both JCF and the Office of the Children's Registry show high rates of sexual victimization. Reported rapes and sexual intercourse with children and adolescents are particularly problematic. According to the 2016 Caribbean Community Youth Report, Jamaica has high rates of early sexual initiation with consequences such as childhood pregnancy (UNFPA 2013), higher rates of HIV/AIDS and interruption in education (CARICOM 2010a,110).

				<p> Where crimes were previously concentrated in the Kingston metropolitan area, JCF crime data by division shows thry are now more dispersed geographically, especially in sub-urban areas. The Jamaican crime situation remains fluid and development presents new challenges for crime prevention and control. </p>
